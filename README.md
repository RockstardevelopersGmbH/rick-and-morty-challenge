# Rick and Morty API Client

## Task
Create a Single Page Application that uses the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to view characters, episodes and locations.

## Features
- Display the items in a responsive grid or list view.
  (The examples are just an inspiration, please feel free to create your design as you think it's best.)
- Implement paging for the this view.
- Clicking a list entry should open a new view displaying the items details (e.g. name, picture, etc).
- Use a routing solution, to open views directly via the URL / deep links.

## Requirements
- Use a framework of your choice (Angular, React, Vue, ...)
- Use a version management (GitHub, Bitbucket) through which you make the project available to us.
